            <h3>Erkan Yaprak </h3>
            <p>My greatest talent is being curious and struggling until I find out.</p>
            <p>My favorite thing is to laugh and make you laugh</p>
            <p>I'm a full stack game developer</p>
            <p>I was born in 2001</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>So far, I have done a lot of work, big and small, with
                many technologies. I've tried a few of the areas a
                computer engineer would be interested in. I also
                did a certain level of research on the ones I haven't
                tried. And I've decided that game development is
                my destiny, and when I'm developing games I get
                more pleasure from anything in the world.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="exclamation">If you've come to this page,
                maybe you're thinking of hiring me. I have a suggestion
                for you.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="exclamation-title">" HIRE ME "</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because I really like game development. I am constantly
                improving myself. I can take initiative (if needed :)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because I am very curious and I learn a lot of things every
                day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because maybe I am not knowledgeable about everything, but
                I can learn in a very short time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because even though my English is not very good, I can use
                "GoogleTranslate".</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because I am very good at teamwork and human relations.</p>
